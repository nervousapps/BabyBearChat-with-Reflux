Put your cert files here.

To make your certificat on OSX :

# Use 'localhost' for the 'Common name'
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.crt

# Add the cert to your keychain
open localhost.crt

Double-click on this new localhost cert. Expand the arrow next to "Trust" and choose to "Always trust".
